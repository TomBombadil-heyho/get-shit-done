# Medicolegal Conventions

## Diagnostic Standards

- **DSM-5-TR** is the primary diagnostic reference for psychiatric conditions
- **ICD-10-CM** codes are included where the clinician's exemplars include them
- Diagnoses must be stated using the exact DSM-5-TR nomenclature (e.g., "Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Moderate" — not "recurrent moderate depression")
- Provisional diagnoses are marked with "(Provisional)" following the diagnosis
- Rule-out diagnoses use "Rule Out" or "R/O" per exemplar convention

## Causation Framework

- Distinguish between:
  - **Direct causation:** Condition caused by the identified event/exposure
  - **Aggravation/exacerbation:** Pre-existing condition worsened by event
  - **Independent/pre-existing:** Condition unrelated to event
  - **Concurrent:** Condition present but relationship to event undetermined
- Use the clinician's established causation language from exemplars
- Never conflate temporal proximity with causation

## Certainty Standards

- Forensic opinions: "to a reasonable degree of medical certainty" or "to a reasonable degree of psychiatric certainty" — use whichever the clinician's exemplars use
- This phrase has specific legal meaning. Do not substitute "in my professional opinion" or "it is likely that" for forensic conclusions
- Non-forensic clinical observations do not require this qualifier

## Citation Formats

- Follow the clinician's exemplar citation style exactly
- Common patterns (verify against exemplars):
  - Inline parenthetical: "(Dr. Smith, Progress Note, 03/15/2024, p. 3)"
  - Narrative attribution: "According to Dr. Smith's progress note dated March 15, 2024..."
  - Abbreviated reference: "(Smith, 03/15/24)"
- Page numbers are included where the clinician's exemplars include them
- Source documents are referenced by the names/titles used in the file material

## Date Formats

- Use the date format found in exemplars consistently (MM/DD/YYYY, Month DD, YYYY, etc.)
- Do not mix formats within a report
- Include dates for all clinical events, treatment encounters, and document references

## Legal Disclaimers and Standard Language

- Some report sections include standard disclaimer language (e.g., limitations of the examination, basis for opinions)
- Preserve any standard language from the template exactly as written
- Do not modify legal disclaimers or informed consent documentation language

## Claimant/Examinee References

- Use the designation from exemplars consistently (claimant, examinee, evaluee, Mr./Ms. [surname])
- If exemplars vary by section (e.g., "the claimant" in S22 but "Mr. Jones" in S23), follow section-specific conventions
- Never use first names alone
- Never use pejorative or dismissive language regardless of case circumstances

## Confidentiality and Scope

- IME reports are forensic documents, not treatment records
- The examiner-examinee relationship is evaluative, not therapeutic
- Reports may be reviewed by attorneys, judges, insurance representatives, and other non-clinical parties
- Language must be accessible to non-clinicians while maintaining clinical precision
