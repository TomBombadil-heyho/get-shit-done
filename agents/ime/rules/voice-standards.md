# IME Report Voice Standards

## General Principles

All report sections must match the examining clinician's established voice as documented in the VOICE_SAMPLES directory. These standards provide baseline requirements — the voice sample cards take precedence where they add specificity.

## Register

- **Formal professional register** throughout. No colloquialisms, contractions, or informal phrasing.
- **Third person** when referring to the claimant/examinee. Use the designation established in exemplars (typically "the claimant," "the examinee," "Mr./Ms. [surname]").
- **First person** only in S23 opinion statements where the clinician renders personal clinical judgment ("It is my opinion that...").

## Attribution Conventions

- Use the attribution verbs found in the clinician's exemplars. Common sets include:
  - **Self-report:** reported, endorsed, denied, described, stated, indicated
  - **Clinical observation:** presented, demonstrated, exhibited, displayed
  - **Records attribution:** documented, noted, recorded, indicated
- Do not substitute synonyms not found in exemplars. If the clinician uses "endorsed" for symptom reporting, do not replace with "acknowledged" or "confirmed."

## Hedging and Certainty

- Match the clinician's hedging patterns from exemplars exactly
- Typical hedging spectrum (clinician-specific — verify against exemplars):
  - Definite: "is," "demonstrates," "has"
  - High confidence: "is consistent with," "is indicative of"
  - Moderate: "appears to," "suggests," "may be consistent with"
  - Qualified: "cannot be ruled out," "insufficient evidence to determine"
- Forensic opinion statements use the jurisdiction-appropriate standard (typically "to a reasonable degree of medical/psychiatric certainty")

## Sentence Structure

- Follow the sentence patterns in exemplars. Some clinicians prefer:
  - Short, declarative sentences for clinical findings
  - Longer, subordinate-clause structures for analytical passages
  - Numbered lists for symptom inventories
- Match paragraph length to exemplars for each section type (S22 paragraphs may differ in length from S23 paragraphs)

## Terminology

- **DSM-5-TR** diagnostic terminology is mandatory for all diagnostic references
- Use the clinician's preferred terms from exemplars, not generic synonyms
- Spell out abbreviations on first use within each section
- Maintain consistent abbreviation patterns from exemplars (some clinicians abbreviate freely, others rarely)

## Prohibited Patterns

- No editorialising: avoid "notably," "significantly," "importantly," "interestingly," "remarkably"
- No emotional language: avoid "unfortunately," "sadly," "hopefully"
- No rhetorical questions
- No first person outside of S23 opinion statements
- No fabricated clinical content under any circumstances
